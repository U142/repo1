1.2.0
=====
CBServer
	* Changed version to 1.2
	* Removed l_testchannel and l_repetitioninterval from one2many operator XML.
	* Added test_channel_category and heartbeat_channel_category to alcatel-lucentt operator XML. (removed)
	* Changed retries for kill messages to infinite (as long as message is active).
	* Changed kill status to CANCELLING, and retries to failed kill messages will not update the LBASEND tables tries or status.
	* Added support for test and heartbeat messages in CreateAlert.
	* Added LBAParameter class which reads values from the LBAPARAMETER table (test channels and system user)
	* Added specific handeling of status code 1029 from one2many api (no cells in area)
	* Changed database to allow recursive triggers (ALTER DATABASE <database> SET RECURSIVE_TRIGGERS ON)
	* Added table LBAOPERATOR_CHANNELNAMES to allow easier editing of operator specific channel names

1.1.3
=====
Installation
	* Updated documentation.
	* Fixed install failing when an older version of the service was already installed.

1.1.2
=====
one2many
	* Changed status so only one of the two information calls is used. CBC_InfoMsgRequest for version < 2.4, and CBC_MsgNetworkCellCountRequest for version >= 2.4.
CBServer
	* Overhauling of the error and exception handling.

1.1.1
=====
Config
	* Added key Live (boolean), true means xml is sent to operators, false means the application stops when it usually would send the XML. The Debug key will now specify if the application should write the outbound and incoming XML to the dump folder, this is independent of the Live setting, so XML for both outbound and incoming calls will be logged if Live is true. If Live is false and Debug is true, it will behave as if Debug was true in version <1.1.0 (outbound XML will be dumped, and application stop before sending it to the operator).
Log
	* The lines 2010-08-11 11:09:41 100065 (op=KPN) NewMessage DUMPED will only be logged if Live is false. If Live is true, these log lines will not be written even if Debug is true. This is to prevent clogging the log file with too much information while running in Live mode.
CBServer
	* Added support for messages >93 characters for one2many. If the message is >93 characters, it will be split into multiple pages. The server will try to split between words if possible. For t-mobile I assume this will be done on their end as they have no page setting in the XML.
	* Added better error handling throughout the application.
	* Made sure logout is always run on the one2many API, even if an exception occurs during send operation.
	* Added check to see if the broadcast has already been sent to the operator. This is to prevent multiple identical broadcasts being generated during retries if one or more operator fails.
	* Added dump for incoming XML if Debug is set to true (need Live = true as well to actually send and receive XML of course, otherwise only outbound XML will be dumped as before).
	* Changed xcord, ycord to lon, lat in CBServer XML (alertpolygon/polypoint). Outbound XML to operator is unchanged. Change done to support interface1 XML output which uses lon, lat instead of xcord, ycord.
	* Fixed missing <IBAG_coordinate_system>UTM</IBAG_coordinate_system> for t-mobile in PLMN messages.
	* Fixed bug in XML parser for PLMN messages (was treated as polygon while parsing which produced an exception when it tried to find the polygon).
	* Added first polygon point in polygon point list for one2many (according to spec it should be coord1, coord2, coord3, ... , coordn, coord1 as with t-mobile).
	* Fixed status updates, was missing some values in LBAHISTCELL.
Database
	* Added column l_successpercentage (float) to LBAHISTCELL.
	* Changed procedure sp_cb_ins_cellhist to check for existing records (to prevent multiple inserts during retries if one or more operator fails).
Self test
	* The default test message is >93 characters to force 2 pages for the one2many api
	* The polygon points are named lon, lat in the XML instead of xcord, ycord
